## Implementation Strategy

This roadmap follows a progressive development approach:

1. **Foundation First**: Establishes the project structure and core utilities
2. **Bottom-Up Construction**: Builds the low-level components before higher-level logic
3. **Incremental Integration**: Continuously integrates components as they're developed
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Includes testing at every stage to ensure reliability
5. **User-Focused Design**: Prioritizes usability and clear interfaces

Each prompt builds directly on previous work, ensuring no orphaned code or disconnected components. The implementation sequence is designed to provide functional milestones at each phase that can be demonstrated and tested.

Follow the prompts in sequence when implementing with a code-generation LLM, providing the output of each step as context for the next to ensure proper integration.
