Create an InputSimulator class that:
1. Uses pynput and pyobjc for macOS-compatible input control
2. Provides methods for key pressing, releasing, and combinations
3. Implements mouse movement and clicking (absolute and relative positions)
4. Adds randomized human-like delays between actions
5. Includes safety mechanisms (emergency stop, input rate limiting)
6. Creates a command queue for scheduling multiple inputs
7. Integrates with the logging system to record all input actions

Additionally:
1. Implement input sequences for common game actions
2. Create a testing mode that visualizes inputs without executing them
3. Add configuration options for timing and randomization parameters
