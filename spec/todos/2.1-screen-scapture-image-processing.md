For the screen capture system:
1. Use the 'mss' library for efficient screen capture on macOS
2. Create a ScreenCapture class that can capture the full screen or specific regions
3. Support configurable capture rates (FPS) with throttling
4. Implement caching to avoid redundant captures
5. Add performance monitoring for capture latency

For the image processing component:
1. Use OpenCV for image manipulation and analysis
2. Implement basic image transformations (scaling, normalization, filtering)
3. Add template matching capabilities for UI detection
4. Create utilities for color analysis and detection
5. Implement region of interest extraction and processing
